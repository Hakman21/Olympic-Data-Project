# Olympic-Data-Project
Program that cleans and filters data, then creates graphical visualisations using the data.


Happy Project Day!!

For today’s portion of the project, you will be using the following dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhanupratapbiswas/olympic-data
And any additional datasets, you think will help.
You need to clean and explore the data and make some initial visualisation – these distributions of columns
Create a test, train split- two subsets of the dataset then feed these into creating models.
Look to creating some regressions models on the data, both linear and logistic.
Afterwards, you can explore other model types such as XGBoost.
Please thoroughly document your code and additionally create a presentation on all the work you have completed as a part of this task.
Tomorrow we will review this and I shall be the stakeholder and provide you points to action
